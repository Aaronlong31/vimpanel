At any time you can add \r\nother roots to the panel.\r\n\r\nTo get rid of a root, select it and use the `:VimpanelRemove` command. This does not delete anything from\r\nthe filesystem, it just takes it off the panel.\r\n\r\nSort your panel entries by editing the Vimpanel storage file. The format of this file is painfully simple:\r\neach line is an entry to the panel. There is a `:VimpanelEdit` command that makes this easier, by opening up \r\nthat file:\r\n\r\n    :VimpanelEdit mypanel\r\n    \r\nYou will need to refresh the panel after this, with the `:VimpanelRefresh` command or the `<F5>` key. \r\n  \r\nInside the panel, focus on a single directory by entering explorer mode:\r\n\r\n    x\r\n    \r\nIn this mode, you can also move up a dir by using the `u` key, or change the root by using the `c` key.\r\nExit explorer mode at any time by pressing `x` again.\r\n\r\nInside the panel, several actions and filesystem operations are available.\r\nCheck the [full list](https://github.com/mihaifm/vimpanel/edit/master/readme.md#mappings-inside-the-panel) below.\r\n\r\nWhen you're done working, save the state of you panel and everything else you have on the screen:\r\n\r\n    :VimpanelSessionMake\r\n    \r\nThis uses Vim's `mksession` command and some extra magic to save the state of your panels (the state \r\nis defined by which dirs are expanded and which are closed).\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to work again, load up that session using:\r\n\r\n    :VimpanelSessionLoad\r\n    \r\nAnd that's about it. To make your life easier, you can use abbreviations or mappings for all these commands.\r\nHere are some recommendations to put in your `vimrc`:\r\n\r\n    map <leader>ss :VimpanelSessionMake<CR>\r\n    map <leader>sl :VimpanelSessionLoad<CR>\r\n    cabbrev vp Vimpanel\r\n    cabbrev vl VimpanelLoad\r\n    cabbrev vc VimpanelCreate\r\n    cabbrev ve VimpanelEdit\r\n    cabbrev vr VimpanelRemove\r\n    \r\nTip: autocomplete works for panel names, so you can press `vl<space><tab>` and get a full list of panel names.\r\n\r\n### Mappings inside the panel\r\n\r\n    <CR> or double-click            expand directory or open file\r\n    <F5>                            refresh panel\r\n    <C-c> or yy                     copy selected node (file or dir)\r\n    <C-v> or p                      paste nodes\r\n    dd                              delete node\r\n    r                               rename node\r\n    a                               add new node\r\n    ff                              copy node path to clipboard\r\n    \r\nYou can use visual selection (`v` or `V`) to grab some files and then press `<C-c>` or `y` to copy them. \r\nPaste them anywhere else with the `p` key.\r\n\r\n### Explorer mode\r\n\r\nToggle explorer mode by selecting a folder and pressing the `x` key. In this mode you can freely explore the filesystem. \r\nThe selected folder will become the root of the tree, but you can change to another root using the `c` key or explore the\r\nparent directory using the `u` key (move up).\r\n\r\nWhy is this mode needed? For 2 main reasons:\r\n\r\n* to keep focus on a single tree\r\n* for the ability to navigate up in the folder hierarchy\r\n\r\n#### How does it work\r\n\r\nVimpanel is built on a heavily modified NERDTree API.    \r\nYou will find many similarities with NERDTree but many key differences as well.\r\n\r\n","google":""}
